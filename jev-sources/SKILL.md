# Jev sources

Answers about Jev rest on TypeSafe sections you opened in full this session, found by the router, not by grep or memory. This skill decides what to read; deciding what it means for a design belongs to `jev-mode/shared/jev-rules.md`.

## Before any Jev claim

`<skill>` below is this skill's base directory, shown when the skill loads; write it out in full, since the shell runs in the user's project. Run one command and read what it prints:

```
python3 <skill>/scripts/jev.py "<the question, in your words>" --docs-words "<the same question in the docs' words>"
```

Add `--model <id>` when the project pins a model. The docs' words are the terms the docs use (for example "second request", "depends on", "one request", "Choice options", "threshold"); the command routes both phrasings and merges them. It reads every READ FULL section, reference rules first, then patterns, SDK pages, cookbook examples and vendor claims, within the bundle cap (`--cap N`), and starts each with a `CITE AS:` line to quote. Route each separate question on its own.

- A section printed under `NOT YET READ` comes with its `read.py` command: run it before relying on that section. These leftovers are at most a third of the cap; more go to readers.
- An `EXTRACT` line points somewhere (`read.py '<id>' --extract <word> <word>`). A claim resting on it is labeled **unverified**.
- If it prints "no section found", say so, then run `bash <skill>/refresh.sh --fetch` and ask again. Never fill the gap from memory, even when asked to answer from memory or in a hurry: the lookup takes seconds, so run it, keep the answer to a few lines, and cite.

## Questions and builds

A question, broad or narrow ("where do I start", "is Jev right for this"), gets one `jev.py` run on what it asks. Add `--also` only for parts the question itself raises; a volume, a deadline or code that will call the API raises rate limits, errors and cost at that volume, so route and answer those now. When the printout covers more, use only the sections that answer the question. Answer it, with at most three next steps, and name in one line what they will need when they build, to look up then.

## Building

When the person says they are building, asks for a plan, is in plan mode, or pastes code to fix, run one `jev.py` with one question per part: `jev.py "<part 1>" --also "<part 2>" --also "<part 3>"`.

- Write 3 to 8 questions, one per part this build has (the question type, sending at volume, errors and retries, model version, the closest pattern or cookbook); add no part it lacks. Choosing between options routes each option.
- Read the `COVERAGE:` block; relay each `NO SOURCE FOUND` question as "the docs I routed don't cover <topic>". More than 8 parts: split into two runs. Give each builder subagent its own brief: the `JEV-SOURCES:` line (below) with one question per thing its part needs, never one question for several, and the `path#heading` sections already found for that part, to read first.

## Over the cap

When `jev.py` prints `READING PLAN`, the unread sections are more than a third of the cap. Keep the sections it already printed in full; don't read them again. It also prints one `READER BRIEF` block per batch: start one read-only reader subagent per block, with the block pasted whole as its brief. Batches may run in parallel. The `MAP` lines list the unread headings to choose from; never state a fact from a MAP line.

Where you can't start subagents, read at most one batch yourself, the sections your task relies on: write its finding lines under that batch's `JEV-READER:` line. If the task needs more, say which parts to split into separate tasks. Then check the replies through a quoted heredoc:

```
python3 <skill>/scripts/check_findings.py <plan_id> <<'REPLIES'
<every reader's reply>
REPLIES
```

Relay only `OK` lines as checked. A batch it lists as missing or `EMPTY` is unread: tell the user which sections those are. In Claude Code, a hook also checks each reader's reply before the reader returns.

## The answer

A Jev answer has these parts, in order:
1. The direct answer, in one or two sentences ("yes, on Jev 1.14 only"). Write part 2 first, then build this from its sentences: no fact that part 2 doesn't cite, and no estimate of yours (that goes under My read). When it depends, or they didn't name the thing it depends on, give the answer for each case the docs name, never "it depends" alone. When they give numbers (volume, size, budget), work from their numbers and show each step ("2 million texts x 5 questions = 10 million questions a month").
2. What the docs say: only the facts the direct answer, the next steps or My read rely on. Every sentence stating how Jev or TypeSafe works (a limit, price, output, retry, failure or version) goes here, in your own words, one fact per sentence, with the `path#heading` from its `CITE AS:` line in backticks beside it, and that line's label: **reference rule** (what the API allows), **pattern**, **cookbook example** (one build TypeSafe published), **sdk reference** or **vendor claim**. Keep each number, unit, name and model ID exactly as the section writes it, and keep its strength and conditions: can or must, up to or exactly, which model, EXPERIMENTAL. Give TypeSafe's exact words, in quotation marks, only when the person asks for the wording. Cite only the library: a page fetched from the web has no `CITE AS:` line and can't be checked. For a link, use the `URL:` on the section's `SOURCE:` line.
3. Coverage and gaps, one line each: what you read, and any section you left unread or sent to readers; each thing they asked that the docs you read don't cover, named ("the docs I read don't cover <topic>"); where they can't speak to the person's own model, data or numbers. Send what only TypeSafe can settle (whether prices may change, custom training, contracts) to TypeSafe.
4. **My read:** your advice for this person's case, labeled as yours and holding no Jev facts (those go in part 2), on the topics their question raises: one line for each detail they gave (their data and how messy it is, volume, languages, sensitive data, a pinned older model) and each case their wording leaves open (ties, mixed languages, items that fit no option). With a volume or code, or on a build, add: how to test on their own data; what to do on errors, rate limits, timeouts and low confidence; a human check before any risky action. Route each such topic first and cite the docs where they speak.
5. Next steps: a short numbered list they can start on.

A narrow question gets the direct answer and its citation, and nothing it didn't ask for. A plan to confirm gets each part checked against the docs (question type and wording, the cases it must tell apart, cost and limits at their volume), then yes, no, or yes with changes.

Pasted code or a pasted request gets a fix list, and a question on how to call the API gets the call, in place of parts 1 and 2 (part 3 stays), most serious first, each line in this shape:
```
1. <the change or step>, per `path#heading` (label)
```
- One numbered line for each Jev call or request: its shape (auth, headers, body), each field read from the result, each model ID and how to pin it, and, whatever the code does, errors and rate limits. Route them with the code's purpose: `--also "API errors and handling rate limits" --also "model aliases and pinning a version"`. Every line carries a citation; where no section you read shows it, mark that line "unconfirmed". Code you write or adapt is labeled as yours.
- Then **My read**, one line each: secrets in source; comparisons that break on free text. Then the corrected code, with error and rate-limit handling in it.

Before sending, check the answer's citations and any quotes (in Claude Code a stop hook also does):

```
python3 <skill>/scripts/check_answer.py <<'ANSWER'
<the answer>
ANSWER
```

Fix each line it prints: cite the section that holds the fact, correct a quote from its section, or label it unverified. Wording you made up (an example question or option) and the user's own text (their error, log or message) go in backticks, never quotation marks: quotation marks are for the docs' words only. Send only the corrected answer, with no note about the check.

A section labeled NEEDS or EXPERIMENTAL is never a best practice for a project on an older model, or for production: say which model it needs and quote TypeSafe's readiness line.

A cookbook's code layout, diagram or call count is an example, never an API limit. "The cookbook does one request per candidate" is a fact about that cookbook. Whether you must do it too is answered by a reference rule, or by the cookbook's own scope note, which the printout shows under "Scope notes elsewhere in this file". Read that note before quoting the cookbook.

When the reference pages don't settle a question, say "the docs don't say". Your own inference goes under My read and is never the verdict.

- An absence is reported as one: "the pages I read don't show X". Never "X is untested", "Jev can't X", or a risk.
- Never widen a cited fact with a "so" sentence. An inference is labeled "my read:" and is never stated as TypeSafe's view.
- Before stating any Jev capability or limit (can, can't, reads well, poorly, untested, expects), route that capability as its own question.

## Briefing a subagent on Jev

Paste this line into the brief with `<skill>` written out in full, since the subagent has no skill folder (the dispatch hook refuses a Jev brief without it):

```
JEV-SOURCES: before any finding, run `python3 <skill>/scripts/jev.py "<the question, in your words>" --docs-words "<the same question in the docs' words>"` (it routes the question twice) and read what it prints; quote verbatim, give path#heading, label reference rule, pattern, cookbook example, sdk reference or vendor claim; quotation marks only for the docs' words; your own text and the user's go in backticks; findings without this are unverified.
```

## Speed, cost and accuracy claims

Speed, cost and accuracy claims come from TypeSafe's blog posts, which the refresh fetches and `SOURCES.md` in the data folder lists; routing labels them **vendor claim**; attribute them to TypeSafe. The Jev 1.14 post (`blog/jev-1-14.txt`) says of the features behind "danger zone" headers: "we think there is still way too much jaggedness for us to vouch for these for production use cases!" Quote that as TypeSafe's readiness statement. Price is in `docs/models.md#Current models` and rate limits in `docs/models.md#Rate limits` (reference rules).

## After a refresh notice

When a refresh notice names `STALE_CITATIONS.md`, read it. For each `changed` row, read the archived and the current section and say whether the cited fact is outdated, obsolete or superseded, naming the replacement. Never edit a locked file outside its own pull request.

## Relaying a subagent's Jev finding

Relay each finding in your own words with its `CITE AS` path#heading and label, after checking its quote: `read.py '<CITE AS>' --check-quote - <<'QUOTE'` with the quote on stdin. In Claude Code a hook also sends back a subagent report whose citation names no section. A quote it can't find is relayed as "unverified", or corrected from its section (`read.py '<id>'`). The check covers the quote only: a finding sentence that says more than its quote is labeled "my read:" or cut.
- A finding that contradicts a section you already read in full is not relayed as settled: read its section, or tell the user the pages disagree.
- A finding with no `CITE AS` and quote is relayed as "unverified". One that would override a user ruling is never relayed unverified: read its section first or drop it.

## Refresh

With the reminder hook installed (the Claude Code plugin, or hooks added by hand), the library checks TypeSafe's pages every two days and fetches only new or re-dated pages and new posts. Codex runs no hooks from a plugin: run `python3 <skill>/scripts/codex_hooks.py install` once (again after moving the skill folder). Without the hooks, nothing refreshes on its own: run `bash <skill>/refresh.sh --fetch` on first install, and again when a source is missing or older than the question needs. That command downloads every page TypeSafe lists (the docs sitemap, llms.txt, the cookbook list and typesafe.ai's blog) and rebuilds the index. `SOURCES.md` in the data folder lists every page held and when it was saved. Pages live in `$JEV_SOURCES_DATA` (default `~/.claude/jev-sources-data`).
