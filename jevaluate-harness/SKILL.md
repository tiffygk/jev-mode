# Jevaluate Harness

The maintainer's process for `jevaluate`. One rating is `jevaluate/read.md`; testing the rubric is the `jevaluate-eval` skill. If `$JEVALUATE_OVERLAY` is set, read that file first; its rules override the defaults here.

## Settings (yours, not in this skill)
- `$JEVALUATE_LIBRARY`: the private ratings library (default `~/.claude/jevaluate-library` if it exists, else `~/.jevaluate-library`).
- `$PRIVATE_TERMS`: your never-publish regexes, one per line. `library.py export` reads only `$JEVALUATE_LIBRARY/private-terms.txt`, so keep the file there (or symlink it) and have your pre-push hook read the same file.
- `$JEVALUATE_OVERLAY`: a markdown note of your own rules for these workflows, read first; no required format.

## Two principles
- **Code checks, text explains:** every rule has a row in `jevaluate/enforcement.md` naming the check that refuses a wrong answer, or why it stays judgment.
- **Ask for what is observed:** raters record type, the calls-Jev line, each decision's stakes as read and the verdict; `library.py add` derives kind and every n.a.

## Workflows
Open the file for the workflow and follow it in order; each step names the gate that must pass.

| Workflow | File | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| Change the rubric | `rubric-change.md` | `jevaluate-eval` passes and the owner approves the version |
| Rate or re-rate projects | `rating-round.md` (rater prompt: `rater-brief.md`) | every rating logged by `library.py add`, scan clean |
| Publish ratings | `publish.md` | one pull request, reviewed |

To see where you are: `python3 jevaluate-harness/scripts/harness_status.py <ledger> --workflow rubric|round` (`round` runs through publishing). It reruns the scripted gates it has (the materials check), reads the other steps from the ledger, and names the file to open next. Ledger lines: `done: <step> <YYYY-MM-DD> <evidence>`. Steps: rubric = rules-written, materials-checked, quiz-passed, eval-passed, owner-approved, frozen; round = picked, sized, costs-approved, rated, scanned, adjudicated, final-gate, release-check, published.

Keep a ledger per workflow: each step, each ruling with its cost if wrong, and tokens per agent. Record rulings and handoffs where your overlay says, or in the ledger.
